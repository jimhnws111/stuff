    <p>Chaotic sky with multiple layers and kinds of altocumulus at several altitudes<br><br>

        Altocumulus clouds generally indicates the presence of instability above the surface,
        though most altocumulus do not display any significant vertical development. Altocumulus at
        more than one level points to rising air causing by lift at different altitudes. Altocumulus
        at various levels can result in a chaotic looking sky, particularly if the sunshine illuminates
        some of the layers and not others.<br><br>

        For the most part (especially over the eastern United States), the height of cloud bases associated
        with the altocumulus clouds preclude much precipitation. However, if there is enough lift in the levels
        containing the altocumulus, virga can occur, adding to the chaotic nature of the sky. In this image
        (taken in Plainsboro, NJ in July 2021), it is easy to see the various levels of altocumulus, with the
        lower levels appearing darker, and the higher levels illuminated by the setting sun. Perhaps the most
        striking aspect of the image is the way the virga (in the center of the screen) is highlighted, adding
        to the chaotic nature of the sky.<br><br>
