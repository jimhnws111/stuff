    <p>Low clouds in a continuous layer, without precipitation.<br><br>
        Stratus clouds develop in the presence of abundant low-level moisture, generally
        associated with a low-level flow ranging from north to southeast. The moisture spreads
        out along a low-level inversion (where warmer and drier air lies just above the low-level
        moisture, preventing the moisture from dissipating). Conditions favoring the development
        of stratus clouds are generally stable, meaning that stratus will remain in place, sometimes
        days at a time, until a change in the weather pattern forces it to exit.

        With little or no lift and shallow moisture, precipitation is unlikely when stratus is in
        place. This image was recorded on an overcast day in Skyline View, PA.<br><br>
