    <p>Mid level cumulus clouds with towers, often with wispy trails of virga.<br><br>
        Known as altocumulus castellanus clouds (often abbreviated as ACCAS by weather forecasters),
        this type of cloud generally forms between 6,500 and 10,000 feet over the eastern US, often
        showing vertical development reminiscent of cumulus clouds during the warm season. They
        indicate the presence of instability in the mid-levels of the atmosphere. When they appear during
        the cool season (early March in this example) or in the late afternoon, ACCAS provide interesting
        cloud formations, but almost never rain (outside of a few sprinkles). The atmosphere is simply
        too dry to support storm development.<br><br>

        However, during the warm season (April through September), ACCAS developing in the morning hours
        is usually indicative of numerous and often strong thunderstorms during the afternoon and evening
        hours. As the lower atmosphere warms after a relatively cool start to the morning, it allows access
        to the mid-level instability in which these clouds usually form. The presence of ACCAS can presage
        the development of strong thunderstorms in the afternoon hours, often with strong winds, hail, and
        heavy rainfall.<br><br>

        The ACCAS clouds in this image developed over Hershey PA during the late afternoon in March 2023.
