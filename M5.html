        Altocumulus clouds are typically indicative of instability in the mid-levels of
        the atmosphere, which is why they bear some resemblance to stratocumulus in the
        lower levels. Much like stratocumulus, altocumulus clouds usually have little
        vertical extent, as the air above them is warmer and drier, forcing the moisture
        to spread out. Banding of altocumulus clouds often suggests channels of warm air
        riding up and over the cooler air in place, and the banding shows where the upward
        motion associated with the warmer air is the strongest.<br><br>

        In this image (which was captured in Nishinomiya, Japan), there are at least two
        levels of altocumulus, indicating that rising air is occurring at these levels.
        Ahead of approaching precipitation, it is not unusual to see one or more decks of
        altocumulus that lower with time, eventually becoming stratocumulus. Dry air below
        the altocumulus generally prevents precipitation with these clouds, but they can be
        an indication that precipitation is possible in the future.<br><br>
