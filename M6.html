    </figure>

    <p>This type of altocumulus is like stratocumulus (L4), except these clouds form
        as a result of moist, unstable air rising ahead of a cold front or mid-level
        disturbance. The moisture and instability allow pre-existing clouds (such as
        cumulus or cumulonimbus) to produce showers and thunderstorms. When these cells
        weaken, they lose their connection to the lower-level moisture that fed the storms
        but continue to rise in the unstable airmass.<br><br>

        Often these clouds will spread out, and begin to resemble stratocumulus, just at
        a higher level. When the altocumulus forms, the areal coverage of showers
        and thunderstorms diminishes. This image was taken in Skyline View, PA, just
        as a mid-level disturbance crossed the location. To the east, storms continued, but
        to the west, clouds started to thin out.<br><br>
