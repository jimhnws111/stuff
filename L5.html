    <p>One or more layers of stratocumulus, not a result of spreading cumulus<br><br>

        Stratocumulus (like the continuous area seen in the image above) often forms when moisture
        is trapped beneath what is known as a subsidence inversion. Warmer and drier air just above
        the cloud layer acts like a ceiling, forcing the moisture to spread out along and under the
        ceiling. Typically, skies are mainly clear above the cloud layer, but few breaks in the clouds
        are noted, as is the case in this image. If the warmer and drier air remains in place above the
        cloud layer, the stratocumulus deck can stay in place for days.<br><br>

        Since the moisture feeding the clouds is relatively shallow, little or no precipitation is
        expected. The persistent stratocumulus deck in this image was captured over Boulder CO, which
        was remarkably lush and green at the time.<br><br>
