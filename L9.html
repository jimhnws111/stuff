    <p>Very tall summits with anvil-shaped upper part<br><br>

        Cumulonimbus clouds (CB) are very large, tall cumulus clouds, and
        indicate the mature stage of a thunderstorm. As the storm peaks in
        intensity, it forms an anvil, which is the top of the storm being blown
        in the direction of the mid-level wind. By this stage, the CB are producing
        strong winds, heavy rain, hail and possibly tornadoes. Over the eastern United
        States, CB clouds with anvils are seen much less often than in the central
        Plains, mainly because of tree cover and terrain. In addition, heavy rainfall
        often obscures the details of the CB, which also makes these clouds difficult
        to discern.<br><br>

        In this image (captured in Waldorf, MD), a mature CB has just developed an
        anvil, with fibrous clouds pointing toward the observer. The top of the CB
        is illuminated by sunlight reflecting sunshine to the west, and by continuous
        in-cloud lightning. Because the track of the storm took it away from the observer,
        the camera caught an excellent look at the anvil.<br><br>
