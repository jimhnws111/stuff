    <p>Moderately tall cumulus with rounded puffy tops, which may occur with cumulus and/or
        stratocumulus.<br><br>

        Moderate cumulus forms in much the same way as daytime cumulus, but the airmass is generally
        warmer and contains more moisture. The combination of warmth and moisture allows the cumulus
        to build more quickly, as the air parcels are generally much warmer than their surroundings.
        The ribbon of rising air associated with the parcels is known as an updraft. While daytime cumulus
        has no updrafts, the updraft in the moderate cumulus is strong enough to allow a column to form,
        which is usually tall enough to distinguish it from the main cumulus clouds.<br><br>

        On their own, moderate cumulus tend to produce only light showers. However, in a favorable environment,
        moderate cumulus can grow into cumulonimbus, which could support heavy rainfall. This image was captured
        near Altoona, PA. These cumulus clouds grew into cumulonimbus and produced thunderstorms about two hours
        later.</p>
