        Altocumulus clouds typically indicate instability in the mid-levels of the
        atmosphere, which is why they resemble stratocumulus in the lower levels.
        Much like stratocumulus, altocumulus clouds usually have little vertical extent,
        as the air above them is warmer and drier, forcing the moisture to spread out.
        Banding of altocumulus clouds often suggests channels of warm air riding up and
        over the cooler air in place, and the banding shows where the upward motion associated
        with the warmer air is the strongest.<br><br>

        In this image (which was captured over Brainerd Lake in Cranbury, NJ), there are at
        least two levels of altocumulus, indicating that rising air is occurring at these levels.
        Most of the clouds are opaque, but there are some breaks, which means that the dry air from
        above is helping to erode the altocumulus. Though the air below the clouds is dry, there are
        some hints at virga particularly in the clouds in the background.<br><br>
