    <p>Veil not covering the whole sky nor increasing in coverage<br><br>

        Cirrus clouds remaining relatively stable with respect to sky cover
        (not covering the whole sky) and not increasing in coverage does not
        necessarily indicate any imminent change to the weather. This is most
        likely because the moisture feeding the cirrus development is not
        increasing or that the lift associated with a jet streak has not increased
        significantly.<br><br>

        The cirrostratus (along with filaments of cirrus) in this image was captured
        over Skyline View PA just after sunset. Refraction from the sun (which had set
        about 45 minutes earlier) continued to illuminate the cirrus and cirrostratus. <br><br>
