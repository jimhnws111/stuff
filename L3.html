    <p>Very tall cumulus with summits, which lack sharp outlines and are not anvil-shaped.<br><br>

        Cumulonimbus clouds are towering in vertical extent, usually forming in an airmass
        the supports rapidly rising air parcels found in warm and humid conditions. The rising
        parcels form a strong updraft, which allows the cloud tops rise well above the parent
        cumulus cloud. Often there are one or more updrafts in a quickly developing cumulonimbus
        cloud, resulting in several towering clouds tops. In this image, you can see several updrafts,
        each featuring bright white tops. These tops are glaciated, or are composed of almost all ice
        crystals, indicative of a strong thunderstorm in the developing stage.<br><br>

        This cumulonimbus is not quite mature, since it does not feature an anvil top, a flat cloud that
        sits atop the storm. However, even in the developing stage, the cumulonimbus cloud can produce
        heavy rain, strong winds and hail. This storm was photographed at East Hanover Community Park in
        Grantville, PA.<br><br>
