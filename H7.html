        Once cirrostratus has finished “invading” the sky, it is referred
        as a veil of high clouds. Generally, the cirrostratus is thin enough
        to allow sunshine or moonshine to be visible, but if it continues to
        thicken, it can become opaque and obscure the entire sky.<br><br>

        A cirrostratus veil often marks a process in which the moisture throughout
        the atmosphere is increasing, and it is not unusual for altostratus to begin
        to appear shortly after the cirrostratus covers the entire sky. During the
        cool season (October through April), cirrostratus can be indicative of steady
        precipitation with 24 hours, but during the warm season, it is not certain
        rain follows cirrostratus. The cirrostratus in this image (which was
        taken over north Harrisburg PA) was thin enough to allow sunshine at times.<br><br>
