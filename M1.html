    <p>Sky full of translucent mid level clouds that are gray, shapeless and produce
        no halo.<br><br>

        Altostratus clouds are composed of mostly opaque water droplets or a mix of water
        droplets and ice crystals, found between 7,000 feet and 20,000 feet, and occasionally
        thin enough to allow the sun or moon to shine through. Because of their altitude,
        altostratus rarely produce precipitation, and the depth of the clouds are insufficient
        to support processes for precipitation to form.<br><br>

        Often altostratus is a transition between thickening cirrus clouds and lower nimbostratus
        clouds, as the moisture in the airmass increases. Increasing and thickening altostratus
        is a good indicator of approaching steady precipitation (generally within 12 to 24 hours).
        This image shows altostratus that is thin enough to allow sunshine through the veil, but
        does not produce a halo.<br><br>
