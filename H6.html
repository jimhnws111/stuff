    <p>Cirrostratus increasing in density and covering much of, but
        not the entire sky.<br><br>

        Cirrostratus clouds often vary in thickness, as well as areal coverage,
        and are typically diffuse except at the edges. These clouds indicate large
        areas of moisture at the high levels of the atmosphere. In some cases, the
        high-level moisture can be an indication of an approaching storm, as the
        higher clouds gradually become obscured by lower clouds.<br><br>

        In this picture, the cirrostratus is increasing from the west, and lower clouds
        can be seen near the horizon. A mid-level system is moving toward Plainsboro, NJ,
        and the high clouds associated with that feature are covering almost all the sky.
        The cirrostratus is innocuous, as the weather pattern is more conducive to
        thunderstorms than a steady rainfall.<br><br>
