    <p>Stratocumulus not from spreading cumulus, with cumulus bases at a different level.<br><br>
        Typically, stratocumulus clouds and cumulus clouds develop due to different physical processes.
        Stratocumulus forms when drier and warmer air just above the clouds force them to spread out and
        prevent much in the way of vertical extent. Cumulus clouds usually form in the presence of unstable
        conditions, which allows air parcels to rise if they are warmer than the surrounding air, resulting
        in vertical cloud development. With such disparate conditions in which these clouds form, they are
        not often seen in tandem.<br><br>

        However, there is at least one set of conditions that allow stratocumulus and cumulus to exist coincidentally.
        During the warm season, it is not unusual for stratocumulus to be in place during the morning hours, until
        sufficient sunshine allows the drier and warmer air just above the clouds to sink, causing the stratocumulus to
        start dissipating. If there is any instability above the stratocumulus layer as it breaks up, that instability
        could allow cumulus clouds to form in the breaks.<br><br>

        In this image, the morning stratocumulus clouds are breaking as warmer and drier air just above it is causing
        the clouds to slowly break up on the east side of the Thames River in London UK. Almost immediately, cumulus
        clouds start to pop in the breaks in the stratocumulus clouds, and the tops of the cumulus clouds are white
        (indicating the presence of ice), as opposed to the slate gray of the stratocumulus.<br><br>
