    <p> Increasing density and coverage of cirrus, but coverage does not
        reach midway above the horizon.<br><br>

        Cirrostratus clouds often varying in thickness, can cover large areas,
        and unlike cirrus, have sharpness only on their edges. Occasionally
        cirrostratus is thick enough to obscure the sun or the moon, and
        light scattered by ice crystals can result in “sun dogs”, a circle
        of rainbow-like colors.<br><br>

        These clouds indicate large areas of moisture in the high
        levels of the atmosphere, possibly ahead of a larger storm system.
        Because the clouds are often distant from the observer, they appear
        to cover less than half of the sky. The thin cirrostratus in this image
        was captured by a drone over Fairview Park, West Hanover PA.<br><br>
