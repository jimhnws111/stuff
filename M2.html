    <p>Thick opaque coverage of altostratus, or altostratus and nimbostratus.<br><br>
        Altostratus clouds are composed of mostly opaque water droplets or a mix of water
        droplets and ice crystals, found between 7,000 feet and 20,000 feet, and occasionally
        thin enough to allow the sun or moon to shine through. Because of their altitude,
        altostratus rarely produce precipitation, and the depth of the clouds are insufficient
        to support processes for precipitation to form.<br><br>

        Often altostratus is a transition between thickening cirrus clouds and lower nimbostratus
        clouds, as the moisture in the airmass increases. Increasing and thickening altostratus
        is a good indicator of approaching steady precipitation (generally within 12 to 24 hours).
        As the airmass moistens, altostratus and nimbostratus can and do coexist, with precipitation
        falling as nimbostratus becomes more prevalent.<br><br>

        This image shows altostratus across the top of picture (taken over Skyline View, PA) and
        nimbostratus across the bottom. At the time of the picture, there was no rain, but soon after,
        light rain started falling as the altostratus became obscured by the nimbostratus.<br><br>
