    <p>Lens shaped atltocumuls clouds often formed by air moving over mountains.<br><br>

        Altocumulus Standing Lenticular (ACSL) clouds form in the presence of fast moving
        air forced up and over mountains or hills that are perpendicular to the direction of
        the wind flow above the topographic obstruction. ACSL develop in between mountains
        where moisture is present. ACSL clouds can form anywhere downstream of mountains and
        hills, but are more common across the western United States, due to its complex terrain.
        ACSL also indicate the presence of severe turbuluence, an aviation hazard.

        These clouds are continuously developing and dissipating in more or less the same place,
        so ACSL clouds appear to be standing still. Because of their peculiar look and the fact
        that they appear to be stationary, ACSL clouds are often mistaken as UFOs.<br><br>
