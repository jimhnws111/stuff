    <p>Filaments, strands or hooks, increasing in coverage and generally
        thickening as a whole.<br><br>

        Cirrus clouds are generally composed of ice crystals and found
        between 20,000 and 60,000 feet. Cirrus is usually white, as the
        cloud have undergone glaciation, a process in which any supercooled
        water droplets are transformed into ice crystals. A general increasing
        in coverage of cirrus, as well as thickening, can indicate the approach
        of a cold front or area of low pressure, portending the eventual arrival
        of precipitation.<br><br>

        However, thickening cirrus can simply indicate a patch of moisture linked
        to a mid-level trough. In this case, the clouds generally pass with no adverse
        weather associated with them. In this image, captured over Skyline View, PA, the
        increasing and thickening cirrus was not a precursor of any significant weather,
        but did result in a spectacular post sunset view<br><br>
