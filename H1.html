    <p>Cirrus clouds consist of straight, nearly straight, or curved filaments,
        strands or hooks.<br><br>

        Cirrus clouds are generally composed of ice crystals and found between
        20,000 and 60,000 feet. Cirrus is usually white, as the cloud have undergone
        glaciation, a process in which any supercooled water droplets are transformed
        into ice crystals. However, depending on the thickness of the cirrus and the
        angle of the sun, cirrus can appear to be darker, or even contain “sun dogs”,
        circles with rainbow like colors.<br><br>

        Strands, hooks, or filaments of cirrus clouds indicate the presence of a local
        jet streak, or the general direction of the wind flow at the levels of the clouds.
        These clouds appear during fair weather and are not generally associated with
        precipitation in the near term. This image shows filaments of cirrus over the Cahokia
        Hills located in Collinsville, IL.<br><br>
