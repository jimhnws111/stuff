    <p>Dense cirrus with white puffs, sprouting cirrus and cirrus in tufts<br><br>

        Unlike typical cirrus, these cirrus clouds are thicker, often appearing with
        white puffs along with wispy edges. The thickness of the cirrus indicates deep
        moisture in the higher levels of the atmosphere. Occasionally these cirrus clouds
        are the remnants of cumulonimbus clouds (CB), typically after the CB has dissipated.<br><br>

        In this image (taken over TD Bank Park in Somerset NJ), the cirrus presents both
        puffs and tufts. Normally these features would appear white, but the setting sun
        produced vivid colors through the fibrous high clouds. Seemingly not associated with
        any leftover CB clouds. the cirrus here appeared to reflect the copious amount moisture
        high in the atmosphere.<br><br>
