    <p>Thin white ripples or small puffs, which may be accompanied by
        some cirrus/cirrostratus.<br><br>

        Instability in the higher levels of the atmosphere sometimes
        manifests itself as small puffy clouds at or above 20,000 feet.
        Known as cirrocumulus, they resemble cumulus or altocumulus, but
        are generally much smaller in size. Though the presence of instability
        in the higher levels can be represented by cirrocumulus, the amount of
        instability at that level does not mean that any significant weather
        is imminent.<br><br>

        Cirrocumulus is a relatively rare sighting, as instability sufficient
        to cause these cloud types to form is not often observed. The cirrocumulus
        in this image is surrounded by cirrus, but are still instantly recognizable,
        despite their small size.<br><br>
