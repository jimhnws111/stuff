    <p>Ragged shreds of low clouds during precipitation, usually seen below altostratus or nimbostratus.<br><br>
        Both stratus fractus and cumulus fractus form in the presence of precipitation, as the falling rain
        or snow increases the low-level moisture to the point of saturation. Stratus fractus forms when there
        is little in the way of lift or instability in the airmass, and the precipitation associated with these
        clouds is generally light (possibly falling as drizzle). While stratus fractus can form anywhere with
        favorable conditions, they can often be found near hills and mountains, where the upslope flow along
        the terrain helps saturate the low level airmass.<br><br>

        Cumulus fractus forms in very much the same way as stratus fractus, but low-level lift may allow these
        clouds to have limited vertical development. Like stratus fractus, cumulus fractus is typically associated
        with light precipitation, and more readily forms in the presence of terrain. Both cloud types can pose an
        aviation hazard, as the low clouds and precipitation can produce low ceilings and poor visibility. This image
        shows cumulus fractus on the western shore of Puget Sound, just west of Seattle, WA, with terrain in the
        background.<br><br>
