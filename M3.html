    <p>Translucent bands or patches of altocumulus in a relatively continuous layer.<br><br>

        Altocumulus clouds form higher in the atmosphere than cumulus clouds, typically
        between 7,000 and 15,000 feet. Usually flatter and thinner than their lower counterpoints,
        these clouds form in the presence of moisture and lift in the mid-levels of the atmosphere,
        without instability in place. Because of this, they rarely produce precipitation, but can
        be predecessors of showers and storms if the clouds lower.<br><br>

        Altocumulus often appear as patches or sheets, and occasionally seem to have scales (some
        varieties of altocumulus have been said to produce a “mackerel sky”). Occasionally altocumulus
        is thin enough to allow the sun or moon to be visible. In this image, the altocumulus is in a
        continuous sheet, with breaks that allow the setting sun to be visible on a late December afternoon
        in Plainsboro, NJ.<br><br>
