    <p>Thin and ragged with continuously changing edges; forms during fair weather by daytime heating.<br><br>

        This type of cumulus usually forms in the late morning hours, as the sun warms the lowers levels
        of the atmosphere, resulting in air bubbles that rise. Once the air bubbles become saturated, they
        form clouds that appear billowy. As the air bubbles encounter colder temperatures, the cumulus
        stops building, and eventually dissipates. During this process, edges of the clouds may expand and
        contract, causing the shapes of the clouds to change. By evening, with the heating of the day having
        passed, all of the clouds disappear.<br><br>

        Typically, daytime cumulus do not produce precipitation, as the airmass in which they form is too
        dry for rain or snow showers, though a sprinkle or flurry is possible during the afternoon. This image
        was taken by a drone over Fairville Park in West Hanover, PA.</p>
