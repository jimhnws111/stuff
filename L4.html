    <p> Spread out cumulus occurs when vertical development stabilizes. Sometimes occurs simultaneously
        with cumulus.<br><br>

        Once cumulus development reaches its peak in the early afternoon, they become “flattened” by drier
        and warmer just above them. Known as a subsidence inversion, air moving downward from above stops
        the development of the cumulus, forcing the clouds to become spread out. As the clouds spread out,
        they cover more of the sky, often resulting in mostly cloudy conditions. Most often cumulus spreading
        into stratocumulus occurs during the cool season (roughly October through April), as the darker bottoms
        of the stratocumulus often contrast with the breaks in the blue skies seen between the clouds.<br><br>

        Typically, the stratocumulus dissipates before nightfall, as heating from the sun in the main force
        driving cloud development. Sprinkles or flurries can occur as the cloud formation changes shape, but
        generally there is simply not enough moisture in the air to support anything more than spotty, light
        precipitation. This image was snapped by a drone looking south over the Susquehanna River near Riverfront
        Park in Wrightsville PA.<br><br>
