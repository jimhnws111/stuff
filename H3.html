    <p>Dense cirrus remaining from a CB anvil<br><br>

        Once the upper part of an cumulonimbus (CB) clouds, these cirrus are the dense anvil shaped remains.
        As the anvil dissipates, the anvil is left behind. Though they can maintain their
        shape for a time after the dissipation of the CB, these clouds gradually spread out and
        dissipate. <br><br>

        Across the Northeast, it is uncommon to see this type of cirrus, as trees and other clouds
        often obscure the sky when thunderstorms are present. <br><br>
